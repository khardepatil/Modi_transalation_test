# Modi_transalation_test
This is to determine effort required to implement the problem statement on larger scale. 

# Aim : 
To gather sample models which can sort test images into class categories as per in train folder.
To get suggestions on the dataset for images, on pixel sizes, quality of images.
To determine effort required to implement translation on larger scale. 
To get optimized process to turn images to pixel dataset that can be used by other developers for model creation with minimal efforts.

# Problem statement :
Given a character or alphabet of Modi lipi, model should be able to determine its equivalent Marathi alphabet or english alphabet. If the modi character is ambiguous then model should give 5 of its best matching euivalent characters from english or marathi language.
There is no restriction on refrence language, english or marathi, choose whichever language you need.
You can choose any programming language you prefer as long as we get the csv dataset for images and model that can classify the test images.


# Details :
There are 25 images of each 5 alphabet in train folder and 5 each in test folder.
Pixel size is 100 * 100 for each image.

# Creating and submitting model guidlines :
1. While cloning make sure your repository name start with prefix "model_" and suffix with your name
2. Make sure you are saving the best result model while uploading
3. Upload with your code notebooks and sample results
4. If possible upload confusion matrix for best working model
5. If you created the pixel dataset for given images, upload the process and dataset.
